VIBE CODING CHALLENGE - GuTEC ZPIRE

This file will contain the three following parts. 
A) AI Interaction Overview 
B) Prompting Details 
C) Project Evolution 

First Part - A) AI Interaction Overview

We used ChatGPT, specifically, model GPT-4.1, as our primary generative AI tool throughout the development of our IBS self-management web app. Whilst other models, such as deepseek and GPT-5 have stood out for their vast knowledge,
robust outputs and strong logical reasoning skills, we have found model 4.1 to be the one of the most all-rounded, reliable and resonating companions that could have assisted us in this project.  

ChatGPT 4.1 has assisted us greatly in helping us 
- Brainstorm user onboarding, refining major app elements and general user flow, ensuring a logical and systematic progression for users who are using the app.
- Research details in Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); hence coming up with a holistic approach where these two worlds can find a collaborative ground. 
- Provide technical suggestions for data entry, storage, analysis and export for our app's "Progress Report" function.
- Troubleshoot and refine our approach to trigger analysis.
- Point out small, helpful yet crucial details; such as changing the background colour depending on the user's current mood/state, managing to help make sure that our app's focus is on healing; not competition and over-gamification.

Second Part - B) Prompting Details and Helpful Assistance for our Creative Designing Process

AI has provided great help by giving constructive and productive ideas for both our landing page and our application. 

Prompt 1: 
"Can you list and briefly describe the key features of our IBS wellness app for the landing page? Please keep the tone user-friendly and reassuring."

AI Response:
Personalized Symptom Logging: Track your symptoms, meals, and daily habits with just a few taps.
AI-Powered Insights: Discover patterns and triggers unique to you, with gentle suggestions for improvement.
Rumbler & Ivy, Your AI Helpers: Our animated guides support, educate, and encourage you on your wellness journey.
Education, East & West: Explore bite-sized lessons from both Western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
Progress Tracking: Visualize your journey over time with easy-to-understand charts and timelines.
Exportable Reports: Download your data and share it with your doctor for more informed care.

Influence on Project:
We used these descriptions to clearly list out and effectively communicate our app’s value on the landing page; making sure that we aren't overly sidetracked with the tiny little details and focusing on the main picture. 

Prompt 2:
"How can we explain the risks of self-diagnosis and unsupervised lifestyle changes to IBS sufferers in a way that is caring and not-so-alarming on our landing page?"

AI Response:
Frame the message around empowerment and support.
It’s natural to look for answers online, but making big changes without proper guidance can sometimes do more harm than good. Our app is here to help you make informed, 
safe choices—combining expert advice, personalized insights, and encouragement every step of the way.

Influence on Project:
This approach helped us develop our educational and onboarding language, keeping it positive and ultra-user-focused all the way. This has become the heart of the framework of the opening statement on IBS 
for our main page, which we have further refined and elaborated on in later stages. 

Prompt 3: 
""We want our IBS wellness app landing page to feel inviting, trustworthy and friendly to our viewers and future supporters. Can you suggest a color scheme, layout, and imagery style? 
Please include ideas for section layouts, background elements, and how to make the page accessible and welcoming for users who may feel anxious about their symptoms."

AI Response:
Color Scheme Ideas:
Soft, calming tones such as gentle greens (for health and balance), soft blues (for trust and calm), and warm peach or coral accents (for energy and friendliness).
Use white and very light neutrals as background colors to keep the page feeling open and easy to read.

Accessibility & Comfort:
Use large, readable fonts and high-contrast text for legibility.
Space out sections with generous margins to prevent overwhelming users.
Include reassuring language and imagery to reduce anxiety (e.g., Rumbler and Ivy offering encouragement).
Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

As well as other helpful elements too.

Influence on Project:
We are not exactly experienced in designing landing pages - but we also don't wish our supporters to feel discouraged by harsh, overly academic or clinical looks for our webpage. Wanting people not to feel anxious about their
own symptoms, we've taken on a neutral, supportive, non-judgmental and friendly yet simplistic tone for our webpage, in order to help this project feel more grounded, more realistic, and much more fitting for our mission of 
teamwork, encouraging slow healing instead of promoting competition, making fast money and corporate-style bureaucracy. 

Third and Final Part - C) Project Evolution 

Some groundbreaking thoughts:
- Whenever we faced creative blocks or uncertainty—such as how to make tracking symptoms feel less clinical or how to visualize user progress - GPT provided concrete, productive, realistic and user-friendly solutions.
  This sped up our design cycle and helped us test and refine multiple ideas more efficiently than traditional research alone, making it especially helpful for avid software learners like ourselves.
- With AI’s help, we crafted bite-sized lessons that balance scientific rigor and cultural sensitivity,
allowing users to easily toggle between Western and TCM explanations. This ensured our educational content was both accessible and inclusive.
- AI’s input consistently reminded us to design with empathy—choosing color schemes, language, and layouts that reduce anxiety and foster trust for users managing a sensitive condition. This helps us prevent our app
design from being filled with an excessive amount of academic or technical rigor that may potentially put our users off when they are exploring the "Education" function of our app. None of our clips will last more than 10 minutes,
ensuring our viewers can both enjoy more, learn effectively and inspiring them to build a friendly relationship with their own gut - which is our biggest dream come true.
- AI suggested the use of animated, empathetic characters to bridge the gap between medical content and user comfort, transforming our app from a standard tracker into an engaging, supportive companion.
- This creative leap fundamentally shaped the tone and UI of our solution. Whilst Rumbler and Ivy are our original characters, integrating them more fully into our application has been nothing short of a breakthrough.

Finally:

We really appreciate your time in looking at our project. Seriously - we really do. We just want to see a happier world with happier people and happier guts, you know? After all - our body, mind and spirit are all interconnected.
To honour ourselves - we must first learn to appreciate, and to honour our vessel - this wonderful vessel bestowed upon us by the universe. These beautiful organs, from stomachs to intestines - they are all beyond miraculous.
They are our friends, our buddies, and our closest companions. May the world be filled with light - that is our motto.
